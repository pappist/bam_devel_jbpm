    <title>Getting started</title>
    
    <para>If you like to take a quick tutorial that will guide you through most of the components
    using a simple example, take a look at the Installer chapter.  This will learn you how to download
    and use the installer to create a demo setup, including most of the components.  It uses a simple
    example to guide you through the most important features.  Screencasts are available to help you
    out as well.</para>
    
    <para>If you like to get read more information first, the following chapters first focus on the core
    engine (API, BPMN 2.0, etc.).  Further chapters will then describe the other components and other
    more complex topics like domain-specific processes, flexible processes, etc.  After reading the core
    chapters, you should be able to jump to other chapters that you might find interesting.</para>
    
    <para>You can also start playing around with some examples that are offered in a separate download.
    Check out the examples chapter to see how to start playing with these.</para>
    
    <para>After that, you should be ready to start creating your own processes and integrate the engine
    with your application, for example by starting from the installer or another example, or by starting
    from scratch.</para>
